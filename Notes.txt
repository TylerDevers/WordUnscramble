SImple Calculator

Alogrithm
    1. Get input from user
    2. if input not a number, print warning
    3. get next number, 
    4. trigger warning if not a number
    5. get operation input from user
    6. lower case the operation for case insensitivity
    7. allow for 'add' and 'subtract' etc words or symbols

Flow CHarts
    a visual representation of an algorithm - must represent a step by step process
    draw one in draw.io
    1. should have an entry and exit point
    2. parrallelagram  = input
    3. diamonds = make decisions based on inputs
    4. rectangle  = operations. process inputs

Console.ReadLine(); gets input from user

strings
    call .Equals() on a string to see if one variable equals another
    concatenate
        can use string.Format() as well as the overloaded operator +
    .Substring(startpoint, endPoint) allows us to slice out a section of text.
    .ToLower(), ToUpper(),
    string Text = string.Empty; is a better way of doing string text = ""; shy away from string literals.
    stringVar.replace("text we want to replace", "new word needed"); 
    string.Empty

Objects and classes
    objects are an instance of a class. 
    when instantiating an object from the new class, we must use the new leyword and constructor

Methods
    methods are just a group of statements that result in a process.

static vs nonstatic methods

Exceptions and throw keywords
    we need to handle the exceptions/errors so that the application does not crash. We want to keep the user experience going.
    Exception is just another class, we can create Exception variables
    throw an exception by
        throw new Exception("exception message");
        
try/catch statements and handling the exception
    try {
        //method code goes here.
        if (something bad)
        {
            throw new Exception("Message");
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        //exceptions thrown will be handled here
        Console.WriteLine("There was an error: {0}", ex.Message);
    }
    
    Using try/catch handles the exception without crashing the program. Not using try catch will cause the program to crash when the exception is thrown.
    we can nest try/catches if needed. but we should not have code running outside the the try catch statements
    we can follow the try/catch with a try/catch/finally 
        statement{ //free up resources from program}
    be careful not to erase the stack trace when throwing exceptions, else we remove the message logs.
    only try/catch exceptions if you are going to do something with the exception.
    
Unit Tests
    add new project to root parent object in heirarchy, make it an mstest. this childs a new test project to this parent.
    reference the class you want to test as a readonly.
    rename the test appropriately. example test class is:
    
        private readonly CalculatorEngine _calculatorEngine = new CalculatorEngine();

            [TestMethod]
            public void AddsTwoNumbersAndReturnsValidForNonSymbolOperation()
            {
                int number1 = 1;
                int number2 = 2;
                double result = _calculatorEngine.Calculate("add", number1, number2);
                Assert.AreEqual(3, result);
            }

Lists 
    a type of data structure used to organize data. Can only hold variables of one type
    size is dynamic, we don't need to specify its size.
    
        List<int> myFirstList = new List<int>();
        myFirstList.Add(10); // type must match list type.
        myFirstList.Count();
        
Arrays
    a type of data structure used to organize information. an array's size must be given when the array is declared.
    
        int[] myArray = new int[sizeOfArrayAsAnInt];
        int[] myOtherArray = {1, 2, 3, 4 };
        Array.Sort(myArray); // call the array class to access the sort method. Pass in our array. Will sort values numerically or aplha?
        
Loops
    do the same thing over and over.
    types of loops:
        for, foreach, while, do
        
value types vs reference types
    a value type is only saved to the stack, which affects how variables are effected.
    reference types save to the heap, which ensures that a change to a variable occurs regardless of which method it being change from
    classes are reference types, methods are value types, structs are value types.
    how to force value types to act as reference types:
        use 'ref' and 'out' keywords. add these keywords like a type with the arguements/parameters
        // this will force the value type to act as a ref, allowing ChangeNumber() to change the 'a' variable.
        static void Main (string[] args)
        {
            int a = 10;
            ChangeNUmber(ref varA);
            Console.WriteLine(a);
        
        }
        static void ChangeNUmber (ref int a)
        {
                a = 90;
        }
    
NUll and Null Coalescing
    null - means no object
        we can point a reference to null by declaring its value as null. 
        Person person = null;
    null coalescing - 
        Person newPerson = person ?? new Person("Default", "Person");
        ?? is the null coalescing operand. This means that if the 'person' is pointing to null, then it will instead set newPerson to the default given.
        
readonly vs const
    readonly
        declares member variables as a constant, but allows it to run at runtime
        public readonly string text = "text";
    const
        declares a constant. will not run at runtime so it must be initialized at declaration;
        public const string someText = "text";
        
read and write to files
    need:
        using System.IO;
    to write:
        first initialize a string array with some values, then use the File class to access the writeAllLInes("filename.txt", string[] contentToWrite) method,
        string[] lines = {"1", "2", "3"}
        // this will create the file and write to it in the location of the current file. Each element will be on a new line.
        File.WriteAllLines("MyFirstFIle.txt", lines); 
    to read:
        // will read from the file, setting each line from the file as a new element in the new array.
        string[] fileContains = File.ReadAllLines("MyFirstFile.txt");
        
        read line by line if the file is large, reading the whole thing may crach the program.
            foreach (string line in File.ReadLines("MyTextFile.txt"))
            {
                Console.WriteLine(line);
            }
            
DRY principle
    Don't repeat yourself
    use methods to prevent repeating yourself. THis can get us around writing many loops
